	<div class="about">
		Hi there! Welcome to my Geoportfolio. My name is Patrick Hong. I am born and raised in Melbourne. As of August 2024 I am in my fourth and final year of the Bachelor of Surveying
		degree at RMIT University. My surveying-related interests include cadastral surveying, GPS work and drafting feature surveys.
		<p>
		My final year major project that I am currently working on consists of looking at current AR/VR tools that are currently on the market. 
		How useful are these tools to the field of surveying? One test I have already conducted was through Adobe Aero. 
		I created a virtual marker at a specified coordinate. Then I went out and visited the same surveying mark, 
		to see the virtual marker could point me in the direction of the surveying mark. Amazingly, it worked well! 
		It was within around half a metre of the surveying mark, which was impressive given that it was running entirely off a smartphone. 
		</p>
		<p>
		My own personal hobbies include walking, eating out, cars and going to concerts!
		</p>

		Capstone (Design) is the first half of the final year major project assessment. It focuses on designing 
		and proposing your very own major project. You are then paired with a supervisor, who will guide you throughout 
		the remainder of the year to make sure the ambitious project comes through to fruition.
		<ul> <!--Bullet points below-->
			<li>Assessment 1: Student supervisor agreement. An agreement signed by both parties 
				that outlines the expected duties from each other. 
				This includes frequency of meetings.</li>
			<li>Assessment 2: Poster conference presentation. Creation of a poster that showcases your major project 
				and it's research questions. Presented to other staff and industry professionals</li>
			<li>Assessment 3: Literature Review and project plan. A report of similar published literature directly relevant 
				to your project. Project plan sets out the expected timeline for the remainder of the year. </li>
		</ul> <!--End of bullet points-->

		Cadastral Surveying Law was another course I completed. 
		It focuses on becoming familiar with key cadastral surveying concepts. Such as:
		<ul>
			<li>Crown Boundaries</li>
			<li>Advanced Principles of Title Reestablishment</li>
			<li>Government and Freehold Roads</li>
			<li>Easements and Reserves</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Cadastral Surveying Law also gave me the opportunity to gain more practical experience, 
		by doing a full surveying in the suburb of Parkville. This was then drafted 
		on a handwritten A3 sheet of paper. Comps were done using closure programs on the HP35s calculator. 
		</p>

		This page will briefly cover all my work experience (as of September 2022) within the geospatial science industry. The two main companies that I have worked at 
		were AAM Group and Tetra Tech. This page will outline my experience gained and skills I have learned from working at AAM Group and Tetra Tech along with an
		overview of my current geospatial skillset.

	<div class="job-overview">
		My time at AAM Group was part of an internship for the thirty day work experience subject. The work experience subject taught me a lot about what industry
		standard work is done within the geospatial industry. I chose to work at AAM Group as I read about it online on how it is a large company that does a lot of
		geospatial activity and to my personal knowledge, is one of the few companies that specialise solely on different forms of geospatial work as their primary
		source of business compared to other companies that have a spatial team but the company itself does not specialise in geospatial work. The work at AAM Group in 
		the Melbourne office was less about performing geospatial analysis on pre-existing data, but rather capturing and collecting their own spatial data which 
		the mapping team process and edit into a usable form for the client.
		<p>
		As part of the mapping team, the work I was exposed to was editing and processing aerial imagery-based data. The work consisted of editing out distortions and 
		errors in the aerial imagery, manipulating colour bands of the orthomosaics to brighten or darken the imagery to the client's needs and creating Digital 
		Terrain Models from provided LIDAR captured imagery from elevation models. My work at AAM Group used less ArcGIS products than I initially believed, using
		other programs such as Global Mapper and AAM-exclusive products due to their Melbourne work being focused on aerial imagery rather than spatial data analysis.

	<div class="job-overview">
		My work at Tetra Tech as part of the spatial team involves using the ArcGIS suite for producing figures and maps for both internal staff members from other
		departments and entites from external companies. The work is primarily modifying and publishing maps based on the specifications outlined by the client, either
		editing the pre-existing data to be updated or creating new figures and information for visualisation on the maps. A lot of the work requires knowledge of
		programming languages such as Python, Visual Basic (VB) and SQL to assist with automating tasks and sorting through spatial databases and attribute tables. 
		<p>
		The work that I have done is not limited to spatial analysis. At one point, I was publishing raster datasets for Web GIS-use and another, I was checking off
		graphs to make sure that the graphs had all the data required on them, either adding the data onto the graph myself if the data is available or outlining the 
		graphs with the missing data for inspection by another staff member if I cannot add the data onto the graph myself.
